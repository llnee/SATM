# SATM - Simple Automated Teller Machine

#### Project inspiration from Appendix in <i> Software Testing: A Craftman's Appraoch by Paul C. Jorgensen </i>. Application was submitted as a final project for a graduate course in Spring 2022.

#### The program allows a user to input a PAN and PIN number for an account, then perform various ATM transactions such as viewing the balance, depositing funds, and withdrawling funds. The GUI is made using the Java Swing library. Current tests achieve 80% class coverage and 69% line coverage and are implemented using Cucumber/Gherkin and JUnit.
